//! Lightbridge agent runner.
//!
//! The per-task Kubernetes Job the dispatcher launches (ADR-0004). It holds no GitHub App key: it
//! reads its task id + control-plane callback wiring from env, fetches the task context (repo
//! coordinates + a short-lived installation token) from the control plane, clones the repo at the
//! relevant commit, runs the task, and reports a terminal status back. The control plane owns the
//! trust boundary — it mints the token and validates findings + writes to GitHub (ADR-0002, ADR-0022).
//!
//! The lifecycle: clone → semantic index (tree-sitter → pgvector, slice 2) → structural index
//! (Graphify → Neo4j, slice 3) → review (the native agent loop, ADR-0026/0037, which acts via mediated
//! write tools the control plane flushes) → report. Indexing is required; the structural graph and the
//! review are best-effort and non-fatal.
