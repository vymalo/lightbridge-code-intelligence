//! The native agent loop (ADR-0026 + ADR-0037).
//!
//! Drives the [`ChatClient`] over the eaig gateway with the [`tool_defs`] surface: the system prompt
//! (the operator-owned persona + the machine tool-protocol) and the request → model → (retrieval +
//! mediated write actions) → … → `finish`. The agent **acts as it goes** — each `add_review_comment`
//! / `add_comment` is buffered control-plane-side; `finish` ends the run and the caller flushes the
//! buffer as one grouped review. The loop is bounded (`review.max_turns`) and treats a tool/argument
//! error as a recoverable turn (the model gets the error text back and retries).
//!
//! Outcome model (#137): the loop returns a [`ReviewOutcome`] — `Finished` (the model called `finish`),
//! `Exhausted` (the turn budget ran out while findings may be buffered), or `Aborted(reason)` (the
//! model called `abort`). **Only a true transport/chat failure returns `Err`.** This is the key
//! behavioural fix: the buffer (which the control plane holds) is NEVER discarded on a clean exhaustion
//! — the caller finalizes on `Finished` OR `Exhausted` so buffered findings are still posted, with a
//! truncation note on `Exhausted` and an abort note on `Aborted`. A transport layer (ADR-0039) wraps
//! each turn with a generous timeout, bounded retry/backoff on transient failures, and a per-run
//! circuit breaker; the HTTP error body is folded into the error so a
//! failed run is legible. Cancellation comes for free: `run()` races the whole task against the
//! self-cancel poll, so a cancelled task drops the in-flight future.
