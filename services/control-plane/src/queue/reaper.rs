//! Stuck-task reaper (RFC-0001 Phase 2).
//!
//! A task can be stranded in `running` if its Kubernetes Job dies without reporting a terminal status
//! — `DeadlineExceeded` (the Job's `activeDeadlineSeconds` is up to 1h, ADR-0004 + #51), an OOM or
//! node eviction, a crash, or a lost status callback. The reaper makes the queue self-healing: it
//! periodically reconciles each `running` task whose claim lease has expired against its Job's *real*
//! liveness (the Job is the source of truth, not a timer — RFC-0001).
//!
//! Per candidate:
//! - **Active** → renew the lease (the reaper-driven heartbeat) so a legitimately long-running task
//!   is never reclaimed — preserving one-Job-per-task (ADR-0004).
//! - **Succeeded** (Job `Complete` but the task is still `running`) → the success report was lost;
//!   mark the task `succeeded` rather than re-running it (which would re-post the review).
//! - **Failed / Gone** (incl. `job_name` null = a dispatcher died before creating the Job) → delete
//!   the dead Job (its name is derived from the task id, so it must be freed before a retry) and
//!   requeue with backoff while `attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS`, else mark `failed`.
//!
//! It currently runs inside the dispatcher loop (a singleton today). Every action is an idempotent,
//! `status = 'running'`-guarded write, so it stays correct even if more than one replica runs it.
