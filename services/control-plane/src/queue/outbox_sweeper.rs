//! GitHub-egress outbox pruning sweeper (ADR-0059).
//!
//! `github_outbox` (ADR-0059) is the single GitHub egress: every outbound content write becomes an
//! intent row the reconciler drains. It is append-mostly — a delivered intent settles to `posted` and
//! a dead-lettered one to `failed`, and nothing ever deletes either. In particular the per-PR 👀
//! `eyes` reaction leaves a permanent `posted` row per PR, and every enqueue (including each re-review)
//! pays an `ON CONFLICT (dedup_key) DO NOTHING` probe against the ever-growing table. Left alone it
//! grows without bound.
//!
//! This sweeper — run periodically by the dispatcher, alongside the index sweeper (ADR-0052) — deletes
//! terminal rows past their retention window: `posted` after `posted_retention_days` (their
//! feedback-join id was recorded at post time, so the row has served its purpose), `failed` after a
//! longer `failed_retention_days` (kept first for post-mortem inspection). `pending` rows are in-flight
//! and never touched, whatever their age. Best-effort + idempotent (a `DELETE` is naturally so): a
//! failed cycle is logged and retried next tick.
