//! Repository data lifecycle (Epic #75, Milestone B).
//!
//! When a repository is removed from the installation or denied by an admin, its indexed data must be
//! purged so we don't retain code for repos nobody opted into: the semantic index (`code_chunks`),
//! the structural graph (Neo4j), the indexing-state bookkeeping (`repo_index`), and any in-flight
//! tasks (cancelled so the reaper stops their Jobs). The repository row itself is kept (status
//! `disabled`) for audit/history.

/// down) is logged and the rest still run, since this is reconciled on the next removal anyway. Safe
