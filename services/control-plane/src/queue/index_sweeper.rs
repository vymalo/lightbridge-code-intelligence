//! Index snapshot sweeper (RFC-0002 / ADR-0052).
//!
//! Every default-branch push writes a full new `(repository_id, commit_sha)` snapshot into pgvector
//! (`code_chunks`) and Neo4j, and nothing reaps the old ones — reviews only ever read the *latest*
//! (`latest_indexed_commit`, ADR-0050). Left alone, a busy repo accumulates a full duplicate index per
//! push in both stores. This sweeper — run periodically by the dispatcher, like the task reaper — keeps
//! only the in-use snapshots per repo and prunes the rest from both stores.
//!
//! Keep-set per repo = the latest indexed commit (what retrieval pins to) ∪ every commit a non-terminal
//! task pins (an in-flight review, or an INDEX task mid-write). A recency grace inside
//! [`db::prune_code_chunks`] additionally spares a just-finished index whose task hasn't flipped to a
//! terminal status yet. Best-effort + idempotent: a per-repo failure is logged and the rest continue.
