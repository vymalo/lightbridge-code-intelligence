//! ADR-0059 — the GitHub-egress outbox, producer side. Every outbound GitHub *content* write is shaped
//! here and handed to the queue via an `enqueue_*` helper; the reconciler ([`crate::queue::reconciler`])

//! fetch + validation + rendering happen in the producer and are baked into the row — so the reconciler
//! never parses a diff, it just ships bytes. Every enqueue is idempotent on its `dedup_key`.
