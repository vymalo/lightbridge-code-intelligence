"""Review-quality dashboard — surfaces what the review agent actually produced.

Everything here is Postgres-sourced on purpose: the agent runs as a one-shot Kubernetes Job, so its
output (findings, token usage, turns) can't be pull-scraped into Prometheus. It is already persisted
— ``reviews.findings`` (ADR-0032 priority/category), ``agent_transcript`` (ADR-0034 token usage),
``review_feedback`` (ADR-0035 reactions) — and was simply never charted. This dashboard reads it.
