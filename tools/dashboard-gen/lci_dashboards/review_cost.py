"""Review Cost dashboard — what each AI review costs, by task and by model.

Lets admins estimate how expensive a single AI review is: per-task time taken,
model(s) used, tokens, and an estimated cost; plus by-model averages/p95 so you
can answer "a review on <model> typically costs ~$X".

Data: `agent_transcript` (per-turn `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` / `model`,
populated on assistant turns only — tool rows are NULL) joined to `tasks`
(timing, repo, kind). LCI records TOKENS, not cost, so cost is computed here from
a per-model price map.

⚠️ Pricing is an ESTIMATE, not the authoritative billed amount:
  - Prices are $/1M tokens from ai-helm `charts/ai-models/values.yaml` (the
    gateway's `pricing.standard`), mirrored in `_PRICE_IN` / `_PRICE_OUT` below.
    Keep them in sync when the gateway pricing changes.
  - LCI has no cached-vs-uncached prompt-token split, so this uses the STANDARD
    input price (no cache discount). The gateway applies a much lower
    `cachedInputPer1M` on cache hits, so this figure is an UPPER BOUND — the real
    billed cost (visible on the AI-Gateway cost dashboards) is typically lower.
  - `reasoning_tokens` is a subset of `completion_tokens` (NOT additive), so it's
    already covered by the output price — do not add it separately.
  - Unknown/older models (NULL model, pre-migration-0017) price at $0 and surface
    in the by-model table as `unknown` so the gap is visible, not hidden.

Edit this generator, then `python tools/dashboard-gen/generate.py` and commit the
regenerated `deploy/observability/dashboards/review-cost.json` (CI diffs it).
